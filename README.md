The data comes from 'C:\Data_PoloFr\scrap-python-indian-gov\src\scripts_final_merge\csv_files_merged\Reservation_Sarpanch_Gram_Sevak_Group_Upa_Sarpanch.csv'
and from 'C:\Data_PoloFr\scrap-maharashtra-gp\results\election_dates_wide.csv'

The first file is not the latest version from the "scrap-python-indian-gov" repo.
There is a bug in this repo that needs to be fixed first before being able to use the latest version.
